BRouter profiles testing
========================

Here is an [iPython notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to help test, compare and
review [BRouter](https://github.com/abrensch/brouter) profiles.

You need to have a working BRouter instance to run the tests against it. The
notebook should be commented and self-explanatory.
