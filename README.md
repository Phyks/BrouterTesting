BRouter profiles testing
========================

Here is a very simple web application to help test, compare and
review [BRouter](https://github.com/abrensch/brouter) profiles.

You need to have a working BRouter instance to run the tests against it. More
details about the expected `segments` files and configuration is available
within the webapp.

## Add a new test case

Test cases are stored in a JSON-like structure in the `tests.js` file.
